		 	<p>found something interesting that you promised yourself you'd get to? Those 300 open tabs may indicate others. We get it. There's a lot of interesting stuff out there and you need to keep track of it all, so we simplified it for you so you no longer need to break that promise you made to yourself-or to that sweet little tab for that matter.</p>
		 	<p>Judge it</p>
		 		<p>Our proprietary three tiered judgement system allows you to efficiently judge like never before. The more you want to read it, the shorter time we'll save it. -- Trust us.</p>
		 	<p>Save it</p>
		 		<p>Judged the tab? Good. Give it a kiss and save it. We'll do the heavy lifting, so give your browser a break. Reference it at anytime before it's deleted. It's like a bookmark but better</p>
		 	<p>Get it</p>
		 		<p>After we erase the tabs from your journal, we'll send you a nice little email with only the super important ones you wanted to definitely get to. No judgement.</p>
